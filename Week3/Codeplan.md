# Puppy Years Calculator Code Plan
This is a calculator to find out how old someone will be in puppy years if they are less than a year old. If they are older than a 1 year, then it will give a message.

-inputs
-Capture age value
-output messages

First, I need to have my user input how old they are in years. I will use a form text input to acquire this information.The user will then click on a button to input their answer. I will need to create a button to collect this information. When the user clicks the button, it will activate my calculator function. In my calculator, I need to get the numerical value of the form input. I will get the number, multiply it by 7 to get the output message. This will give me one of 3 messages. Then I'll return a message telling them either how old they are and whether or not they are a puppy in age.
