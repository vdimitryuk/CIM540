    <h1>My New Work Website</h1>
    <p> This website is dedicated to classwork and homework that I will be working on in CIM540. 
        A little bit about myself: my name is Valeria Dimitryuk and I am a 4th year studying architecture and minoring in interactive media. I was born and raised in Miami. One random fact about me is that I am fluent in Russian and have a Russian passport. I look forward to learning about coding so that I can apply new techniques and technology to the way I present my drawings and ideas.</p>
