Code Plan

To create my project I will need to first find a background of a shelf to place my objects on. Next I will find six objects to place onto my background. After that I will place my objects at different points on my background. When the user pans over an object with their mouse, the object will start to rotate on a loop. To do this, I will need to write a code that will start the rotation and loop it. I will also need to write a code to stop the rotation when the user pans away. 

12/4 Update

I have figured out how to place my background without any issues. I have been trying to find a way to place the 3D objects but I am still having issues with it uploading. I have found a library that should help me with what my goal is for the project and should make it progress much quicker.
