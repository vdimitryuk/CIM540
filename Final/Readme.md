Final Project Ideas

1) 3D Gallery Viewer
Creating a gallery for 3D objects. The route I would take is to probably record the 3D objects in a video format and have them linked in the page with an image. I will be using a button function to zoom into the image of the object and it will play the looped video.

2) Drag and drop building game
Create a jigsaw like puzzle for a building (i.e. the eiffle tower). When the pieces are put together in the correct order, they will create a background with fireworks and a message.

3) Running Cat Animation
Create a cat image that will follow your mouse which will be a ball of yarn with a string. The cat will follow your mouse as the background image of a house loops.
